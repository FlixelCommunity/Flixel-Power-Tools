This [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) project contains a suite of demos and example code for the Flixel Power Tools. Load the project into FlashDevelop and run it, or run the SWF in the `bin` folder.

The code of each of the examples is stored in `src/tests`; look at them for examples of how to use the commands.

There is a "Getting Started Guide" in the `docs` branch.
