Flixel Power Tools Test Suite
-----------------------------

Updated 12th April 2011 for compatibility with Flixel v2.5

http://www.photonstorm.com

This FlashDevelop project contains a suite of tests and example code for the Flixel Power Tools.

Load the project into FlashDevelop and run it, or run the SWF in the bin folder.

The code of each of the examples is stored in src/tests.

Look at them for examples of how to use the commands.

Please note:

The Test Suite FlashDevelop project has a Classpath set to both the Flixel Power Tools package, and Flixel itself, in the Project Properties.

So if you checked out just this folder from svn, you'll need to get these as well before anything will compile.
