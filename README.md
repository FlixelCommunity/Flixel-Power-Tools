Flixel Power Tools
==================

Version 1.5

May 9th 2011

By Richard Davey, [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com)

The [Flixel Power Tools](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) are a package
of classes designed to provide extra functionality to your Flixel 2.5+ games.


Quick Install Guide
-------------------

Unzip the file `photonstorm.zip` into the following folder within your Flixel project:

     src/org/flixel/plugin

It should create a folder called `photonstorm` containing all of the tools. The final
directory structure of your project should be:

     src/org/flixel/plugin/photonstorm

and within the `photonstorm` folder you'll find all the classes listed below.


Getting Started
---------------

For now documentation is provided built-in to the classes. AS3 IDEs such as FlashDevelop will
provide context-sensitive help for all classes and functions in the Flixel Power Tools.

You can also check out the home page at http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools and the Test Suite.


Test Suite
----------

The Flixel Power Tools come with a comprehensive Test Suite. Use it to visually see the 
tools in action, and then learn from the source code and comments within.

To run the Test Suite launch the following SWF:

    Test Suite/bin/FlixelPowerTools.swf

If you don't have Flash Player installed locally then open `index.html` in a browser.

The following classes are currently in the Flixel Power Tools:

* FlxBitmapFont
