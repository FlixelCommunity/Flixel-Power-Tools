Flixel Power Tools
==================

Version 1.6 Beta 1

May 17th 2011

By Richard Davey, [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com)

The [Flixel Power Tools](http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools) are a package
of classes designed to provide extra functionality to your Flixel 2.5+ games.


Quick Install Guide
-------------------

Unzip the file `photonstorm.zip` into the following folder within your Flixel project:

     src/org/flixel/plugin

It should create a folder called `photonstorm` containing all of the tools. The final
directory structure of your project should be:

     src/org/flixel/plugin/photonstorm

and within the `photonstorm` folder you'll find all the classes listed below.

Note for the dev branch:

I don't keep the zip file as up to date as the src in the Test Suite. So ignore the above and 
instead copy the photonstorm folder out of:

    Test Suite/src/org/flixel/plugin

to your Flixel plugin folder

Getting Started Guide
---------------------

There is a comprehensive Getting Started Guide in both Word and PDF format in the `Docs` folder.

Documentation is also provided built-in to the classes. AS3 IDEs such as FlashDevelop will
provide context-sensitive help for all classes and functions in the Flixel Power Tools.

Finally check out the home page at http://www.photonstorm.com/flixel-power-tools for updates.


Test Suite
----------

The Flixel Power Tools come with a comprehensive Test Suite. Use it to visually see the 
tools in action, and then learn from the source code and comments within.

To run the Test Suite launch the following SWF:

    Test Suite/bin/FlixelPowerTools.swf

If you don't have Flash Player installed locally then open `index.html` in a browser.
